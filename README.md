# JASMINE FRONT END NANO DEGREE FEED READER

# Does & Don'ts 
- To Avoid errors from Jasmine run the code while online.
- Don't use the link https://movezog.github.io/FrontEnd-NanoDegree-FeedReader-Master/ to access the feed.
- Clone or Download, extract then run the index.html file.

# How the Program was Built 
- No styling was done on the CSS part of the code.
- Wrote a test that loops through each feed for defined URLs & Name
- Using expect,toBe,forEach & toBeDefined function.
- Wrote a code that toggles through the menu's visibility functions.
- Initial Entries & New Feed Selection both uses a loadFeed and a beforeEach function, and they both requires an internet connection .
